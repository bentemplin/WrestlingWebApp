# WrestlingWebApp
Simple web app for scoring wrestling matches.

I created this app in my free time during finals week.
The app is designed to help people score matches, especially if they are not intimately familiar with the ins and outs of wrestling scoring.
More instructions on using the platform and more information about the code are still to come.
